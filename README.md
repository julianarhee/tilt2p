# Tilt 2p designs
This repository contains design files for head-fixing rats under a tilting 2p microscope. The same appartus can be used for habituation. 

## Parts
`dolphin`: Curved arm that screws into `dolphin_plate` to form a bracket that will hold the animal.

`dolphin_plate`: Plate that the `dolphin` screws into, can be mounted onto a motorized stage.

`dolphin_adapter`: Angled adapter that screws into the `dolphin`. The angle should match the angle of the microscope tile (30 degrees). Three circular grooves hold ceramic balls (McMaster) fastened with epoxy. These balls mate to matching holes on the headplate for a kinematic mount. The center throughhole in the middle of the 3 grooves is for fastening the headplate to the adapter.

`headplate`: Titanium headplate surgically implanted to the skull. The large circle should be centered around the cranial window. The three holes mate with the 3 ceramic balls on the `dolphin_adapter`. The center hole is used to attach the headplate to the adapter with a long screw. Recommended to use a wing-nut fastener. 

`headplate_full_assembly`: Full assembly of the main components.

## Misc
`tilting.mp4`: Animation of how the microscope rotates the imaging plane.
